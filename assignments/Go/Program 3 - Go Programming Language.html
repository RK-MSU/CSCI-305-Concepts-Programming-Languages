<h1>Program 3 - Go Programming Language (Due 3/5 @ 7pm)</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>To Do:</h2>
<p>You are to write a program in Go that opens a text file, imports all the data in the text file to your program, takes out all the numbers out of the imported data and then exports the contents into a new text file.&nbsp; Open, read, edit, write.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your program will take the name of the input text file by a command line argument.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your program will need the following functions:
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;main function that calls all the rest of the functions, except error checking function, sends parameters needed to the functions and receives&nbsp;variables back from functions when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A function to open the file and read in the contents of the file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A function to parse out all numbers in the imported file data.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A function to write the new data, without numbers back to the output file.</li>
<li>An error checking function, many of these steps have function&nbsp;calls that return an error variable, that variable should be sent to this function, if there is no error it doesn't need to do anything, if there is an error it should be sent to the panic function (built in, you don't write panic).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The output file name should be taken from user input.</li>
</ul>
